Compiler project for Formal Languages & Translation Techniques 2018

## About
It's written in Python3, all required libraries can be installed using setup.sh (Ubuntu 18.04).

Running 'make' is necessary to compile interpreter, which is used in some optimalisations.

It's not really the best Python you can write, it has some globals etc. but it gets the job done.

## How to use
```
python3 compilator.py input_name output_name
```

Run
```
python3 compilator.py -h
```
for more options.
